Google Auth API using node.js Demo
======================================

A brief demo showing how to authenticate with the Google API using node.js 

# Instructions

* follow the instructions in the [oauth](https://developers.google.com/+/api/oauth) documentation for registering a new app
* pull down this repository and run `npm install`
* open `config.json`, and replace the values with those from the Google Developer's console
* run `node server.js`
* visit the app in your browser, and authenticate with Google

# Notes

Currently, this is incredibly simple, and as such is completely lacking in style, structure, and functionality. This is intended to demonstrate one thing, how to authenticate with Google API with OAuth2, using node.js.
